Horiseon is a web application designed to help businesses become more successful online. Using Search Engine Optimization (SEO) to increase the website visibility and find customers for business.  

Lead Generation,Brand Awareness and Cost Management are all useful tools in creating a successful business online.  

Fixing the problem for this website the following steps had to be taken.   

-Created a title fitting the brand and business.  
-Added HTML semantics to the code example, main,nav,aside,header,footer.  
 Using semantics helps the syntax be better understood.  
-Inside of the nav property added an id "search-engine-optimization" to make link work correctly.   
-Alt attributes added to the images to provide more information.   
-In the HTML syntax created a div class "benefit" and "section".  
-CSS changes, using the new div class "benefit" and "section" condensed the CSS because the H2/H3,img were identical.   
-Commented on the CSS syntax to understand the use of each property.    

The changes made now has the website up and running live, all the links working correctly,the images all visible and provide information and HTML semantics to make the syntax easier to read.
